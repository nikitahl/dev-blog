The Winter is over, and it's been quite busy for me, nonetheless, I did manage to learn a few things and I'd like to share them with you.

1. [JavaScript's document.activeElement property](#1-javascripts-documentactiveelement-property)
2. [CSS motion path](#2-css-motion-path)
3. [Disabled attribute on a fieldset element](#3-disabled-attribute-on-fieldset-element)
4. [Copy object from console](#4-copy-object-from-console)

## 1. JavaScript's document.activeElement property
This method returns the `Element` within the DOM that currently has focus. Quite handy when working with forms.

```javascript
document.activeElement // returns DOM element with focus or <body> if no active focus
```

Supported in all major browsers. Find more on [document.activeElement property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DocumentOrShadowRoot/activeElement){:target="blank"}.

## 2. CSS motion path
A cool feature that:
> allows authors to animate any graphical object along a custom path

Now you can create more complex and intricate animations with `offset-path`. The example below I've made inspired by [CSS IRL](https://css-irl.info/fun-with-css-motion-path/){:target="blank"}.

<p class="codepen" data-height="350" data-theme-id="dark" data-default-tab="css,result" data-user="nikitahl" data-slug-hash="jOPmwWr" style="height: 265px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;" data-pen-title="CSS Motion path loader">
  <span>See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/nikitahl/pen/jOPmwWr">
  CSS Motion path loader</a> by Nikita Hlopov (<a href="https://codepen.io/nikitahl">@nikitahl</a>)
  on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</span>
</p>
<script async src="https://static.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

However, this functionality is not supported by Edge, IE, and Safari. Find out more on [CSS Motion Path](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Motion_Path){:target="blank"}.

## 3. Disabled attribute on a fieldset element
I knew that `disabled` attribute can be set on separate form elements like `<input>`, but it turns out that it can be used on `<fieldset>` element as well.

Add the `"disabled"` attribute on a `<fieldset>` element to disable inputs & buttons inside â€“ all at once. Very handy to disable groups of fields in a `form`.

Find more on the [disabled attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/disabled){:target="blank"}.


## 4. Copy object from console
I actually came across this one on [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10305365/javascript-chrome-how-to-copy-an-object-from-the-webkit-inspector-as-code){:target="blank"} by searching *how to copy an object from the console*.

This method will copy an object from console to clipboard, that you, later on, can paste to an editor or linter.

```javascript
const obj = {
  title: "Developer",
  age: 42
}

// inside console type
copy(obj)
```
Useful when you need to retrieve large objects that come from a request's response.
