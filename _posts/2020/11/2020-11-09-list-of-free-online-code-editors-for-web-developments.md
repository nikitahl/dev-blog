An online code editor is a great way you can quickly prototype something, test, or just fiddle around with a piece of code.

**With an online code editor you can**:

* Access your code from anywhere;
* Share your code with the world;
* Test preprocessors, libraries, and frameworks;
* Create [OSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software) projects;
* Collaborate with different people;
* Bookmark/save/fork other people's projects;
* And more...

**NOTE: While these code editors are generally free some of the features are available only in Premium versions.**

These days there are a lot of online code editors that are free and each has its own unique features and traits. In this article, I'll share with you a list of the most popular ones out there.
