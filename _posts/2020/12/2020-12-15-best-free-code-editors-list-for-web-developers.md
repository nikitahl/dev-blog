A code editor is a tool that a developer is using on a daily basis. It’s like a chef’s knife. A good code editor is going to affect your daily workflow and performance. So it’s a good idea to get a code editor that is functional and easy to use.

These days there are lots of code editors to choose from. The best part is that there’s a lot of free ones so you can try out each one and select the best for yourself.

## Things to consider when choosing a code editor

* Supported languages
* UI should be appealing and easy to use;
* Should contain many features;
* Active online community/support;
* Supported operating systems or platforms.

Luckily almost all of the below code editors supported by all operating systems and are free with tons of useful features to make a developer’s life easier.
