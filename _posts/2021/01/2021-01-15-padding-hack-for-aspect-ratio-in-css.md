When working with media whether it's an image or a video, sometimes you have to preserve its initial proportions (aspect ratio). In this guide, I'll try to explain how exactly you can achieve such a result with CSS.

## What is the aspect ratio?

Usually, when talking about an [aspect ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspect_ratio_(image)) it implies a display or a screen. It's a ratio of width to height.

Most popular are *16:9* (standard for HDTV) and *4:3* (standard TV). So for the *16:9* aspect ratio, it means that the ratio is 16 units of width to 9 units of height.

In order to implement aspect ratio in CSS, you can go either with
1. [`aspect-ratio` property](#the-css-aspect-ratio-property)
2. the so-called [*"padding hack"*](#padding-hack)

## The CSS aspect-ratio property

CSS has an [`aspect-ratio`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/aspect-ratio) property that can be used natively to avoid the *"padding hack"*.

This property does essentialy what you'd expect it to do, apply aspect ratio to an element.

So instead of the `padding-top` property you can use the `aspect-ratio`.

Example:

```css
.aspect-ratio-container {
  aspect-ratio: 16 / 9;
}
```

The `aspect-ratio` property is supported by all modern browsers:
<figure>
  <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/aspect-ratio#browser_compatibility" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">
    <img class="shadow" src="/images/browser-support/css-aspect-ratio-browser-support.webp" alt="CSS aspect-ratio property browser support" loading="lazy">
  </a>
</figure>

## Padding hack

This means that a `padding-top` or `padding-bottom` property must be set on an element with the calculated percentage value that represents the aspect ratio.

In order to calculate the value for the padding property, you'll need to make a division of the ratio values and multiply it by 100%.

E.g.:

* *16:9* aspect ratio will result in `9 / 16 * 100% = 56.25%`;
* *4:3* aspect ratio will result in `3 / 4 * 100% = 75%`;
* *1:1* aspect ratio will result in `1 / 1 * 100% = 100%`.

So to apply it for a `div` element:

```css
.aspect-ratio--16-9 {
  overflow: hidden;
  padding-top: 56.25%;
  background-image: linear-gradient(45deg, #7f14c1, #80fbfb);
}
```

The resulted element below will now always maintain the *16:9* aspect ratio no matter the screen size:

<style>
  .demo-box { margin: 0 0 30px }
  .aspect-ratio--16-9 {
    overflow: hidden;padding-top: 56.25%;background-image: linear-gradient(45deg,#7f14c1, #80fbfb);
  }
  .aspect-ratio--image {
    overflow: hidden;padding-top: 56.25%;background: url("") no-repeat center;background-size: cover;
  }
  .video-container, .embed-container {
  position: relative;padding-top: 56.25%;
  }
  .video, .embed-vimeo {
    position: absolute;top: 0;left:0;width:100%;height: 100%;object-fit: cover;margin:0 !important;
  }
</style>

<div class="aspect-ratio--16-9 demo-box"></div>

## Use cases

### Images

Images comes with a fixed size thus fixed aspect ratio. Consider following image, its size is 1920x1585.

<figure>
  <img class="shadow" src="/images/misc/city-skyline.jpg" alt="City Skyline" loading="lazy">
  <figcaption>
    <span>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@karlkoehler?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Karl KÃ¶hler</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/skyline?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a></span>
  </figcaption>
</figure>

If you change its width or height to match the desired aspect ratio, the image will become skewed as it has a fixed aspect ratio.

However, you can set the image as a background for a `div` container, and provide the container with an aspect ratio.

```css
.aspect-ratio--16-9 {
  overflow: hidden;
  padding-top: 56.25%;
  background: url('city-skyline.jpg') no-repeat center;
  background-size: cover;
}
```

The image will lose its initial size but will take up the remaining space evenly and maintain the aspect ratio.

<p class="note">ðŸ’¡ NOTE: Setting an image as a background is not a good practice to display an image as it is not friendly to assistive technologies. The background image should be set only for <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/2016/WD-WCAG20-TECHS-20160105/F39" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">decorative purposes</a>.</p>

**Result**:

<div class="aspect-ratio--image demo-box lozad" data-background-image="/images/misc/city-skyline.jpg"></div>

### Videos

Videos are another media format that requires proper styling on a page in order to have a more appealing display.

Today the standard video aspect ratio is *16:9* (recommended by [YouTube](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6375112?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en) and [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/blog/post/aspect-ratios-explained/)).

You can use aspect ratio to create container of any size, and then [scale the video to full-size](/full-size-background-video) of it.

To give your video an aspect ratio we'll use the *"padding hack"* along with some other properties.

The markup consists of a container `div` and a `video` element inside it and will look as follows:

```html
<div class="video-container">
  <video class="video" src="runner.mp4" controls />
</div>
```

The container will have a `padding-top` property for the aspect ratio. The `video` element has to have `position: absolute` in order to fit inside the container. Also the `object-fit: cover` and the `height: 100%` properties have to be applied in order for the `video` element to fill up the empty space.

```css
.video-container {
  position: relative;
  padding-top: 56.25%;
}

.video {
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left:0;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  object-fit: cover;
}
```

**Result**:

<div class="video-container demo-box">
  <video class="video lozad" data-src="/videos/runner.mp4" controls />
</div>

<p class="figcaption">
  <span>Video by <a href="https://pixabay.com/pt/users/coverr-free-footage-1281706/?utm_source=link-attribution&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=image&amp;utm_content=10809">Coverr-Free-Footage</a> from <a href="https://pixabay.com/pt/?utm_source=link-attribution&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=image&amp;utm_content=10809">Pixabay</a></span>
</p>

### Embeds

Embeds are a popular way to include images and videos from a 3rd party websites, like Vimeo for videos or Pinterest for images. Embed is an `iframe` element. In this case to give an `iframe` an aspect ratio, we can use the same approach as for videos.

In the example below let's embed a Vimeo video. Markup:

```html
<div class="embed-container">
  <iframe class="embed-vimeo" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/82931517" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>
<p>
  <a href="https://vimeo.com/82931517">Light Goes On</a> from <a href="https://vimeo.com/dariustwin">Darren Pearson</a> on <a href="https://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.
</p>
```

CSS will be the same as for video:

```css
.embed-container {
  position: relative;
  padding-top: 56.25%;
}

.embed-vimeo {
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left:0;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  object-fit: cover;
}
```

**Result**:

<div class="embed-container demo-box">
  <iframe class="embed-vimeo" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/82931517" loading="lazy" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>
<p class="figcaption">
  <a href="https://vimeo.com/82931517">Light Goes On</a> from <a href="https://vimeo.com/dariustwin">Darren Pearson</a> on <a href="https://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.
</p>

## Conclusion

A modern way to apply aspect ratio to an element is to use the `aspect-ratio` CSS property.

It's good to know about the *"padding-hack"* approach as well. You may still encounter it somewhere, as it was heavily used, prior to `aspect-ratio` property.

*"Padding hack"* works across all browsers, even old ones. So if you're working on a project and you need to maintain older browsers, the *"padding-hack"* is your go to way.
